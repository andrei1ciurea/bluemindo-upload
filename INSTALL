Once you installed needed dependencies, you can install Bluemindo,
by launching (as root):
  # make install

If you want to uninstall Bluemindo, just launch (as root):
  # make uninstall

As it's a Python developped software, you don't have to compile it
for using it. Just launch (as normal user):
  $ ./launch.sh
